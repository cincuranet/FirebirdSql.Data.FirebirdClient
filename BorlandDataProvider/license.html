			<P>3. Distribution Obligations. 
			</P>
			<P><B>3.1. Application of License.</B> The Modifications which You
			create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of
			this License, including without limitation Section 2.2. The Source
			Code version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the
			terms of this License or a future version of this License released
			under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License
			with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not
			offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters
			or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
			recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
			additional document offering the additional rights described in
			Section 3.5.</P>
			<P><B>3.2. Availability of Source Code</B>. Any Modification which
			You create or to which You contribute must be made available in
			Source Code form under the terms of this License either on the
			same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
			Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable
			version available; and if made available via Electronic
			Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve
			(12) months after the date it initially became available, or at
			least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular
			Modification has been made available to such recipients. You are
			responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains
			available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
			maintained by a third party. 
			</P>
			<P><B>3.3. Description of Modifications.</B> You must cause all
			Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a file documenting
			the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of
			any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
			Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original
			Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of
			the Initial Developer in 
			</P>
			<P>(a) the Source Code, and 
			</P>
			<P>(b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
			documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
			Covered Code.</P>
			<P><B>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters </B>
			</P>
			<P>a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a
			license under a third party's intellectual property rights is
			required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under
			Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the
			Source Code distribution titled &quot;LEGAL'' which describes the
			claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a
			recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such
			knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in
			Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in
			all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take
			other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
			newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
			Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained. 
			</P>
			<P>(b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an
			application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of
			patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that
			API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL
			file. 
			</P>
			<P>(c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as
			disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes
			that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original
			creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the
			rights conveyed by this License. 
			</P>
			<P><B>3.5. Required Notices.</B> You must duplicate the notice in
			Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it is not possible
			to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
			structure, then You must include such notice in a location (such
			as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to look for
			such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You may
			add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit
			A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for
			the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership
			rights relating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to
			charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
			obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However,
			You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the
			Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
			clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
			obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
			indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
			liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
			a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
			offer. 
			</P>
			<P><B>3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.</B> You may
			distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
			requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered
			Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
			version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this
			License, including a description of how and where You have
			fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be
			conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,
			related documentation or collateral in which You describe
			recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may
			distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership
			rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
			different from this License, provided that You are in compliance
			with the terms of this License and hat the license for the
			Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the
			recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set
			forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version
			under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that
			any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,
			not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree
			to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
			liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
			a result of any such terms You offer. 
			</P>
			<P><B>3.7. Larger Works.</B> You may create a Larger Work by
			combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms
			of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single
			product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of
			this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code. 
			</P>
			<P>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation. 
			</P>
			<P>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of
			this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due
			to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: 
			</P>
			<P>(a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent
			possible; and 
			</P>
			<P>(b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such
			description must be included in the LEGAL file described in
			Section 3.4 and must be included with all distributions of the
			Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
			regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
			recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 
			</P>
			<P>5. Application of this License.</P>
			<P>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
			attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code. 
			</P>
			<P>6. Versions of the License. 
			</P>
			<P><B>6.1. New Versions.</B> The Initial Developer of this code
			may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time
			to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
			number. 
			</P>
			<P><B>6.2. Effect of New Versions.</B> Once Covered Code has been
			published under a particular version of the License, You may
			always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may
			also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any
			subsequent version of the License published by the Initial
			Developer. No one other than the Initial Developer has the right
			to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this
			License. 
			</P>
			<P><B>6.3. Derivative Works.</B> If You create or use a modified
			version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply
			it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this
			License), You must 
			</P>
			<P>(a) rename Your license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'',
			''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'', ''Netscape'', &quot;MPL&quot;, ''NPL&quot;,
			or any confusingly similar phrases do not appear in your license
			(except to note that your license differs from this License) and 
			</P>
			<P>(b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license
			contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
			Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial
			Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in
			Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of
			this License.) 
			</P>
			<P><B>6.4 Origin of the Initial Developer's Public License.</B>
			The Initial Developer's Public License is based on the Mozilla
			Public License V 1.1 with the following changes: 
			</P>
			<P>1) The license is published by the Initial Developer of this
			code. Only the Initial Developer can modify the terms applicable
			to Covered Code. 
			</P>
			<P>2) The license can be modified and used for code which is not
			already governed by this license. Modified versions of the license
			must be renamed to avoid confusion with Netscape's license Initial
			Developer's's license and must include a description of changes
			from the Initial Developer's Public License. 
			</P>
			<P>3) The name of the license in Exhibit A is the &quot;Initial
			Developer's Public License&quot;. 
			</P>
			<P>4) The reference to an alternative license in Exhibit A has
			been removed . 
			</P>
			<P>5) Amendments I, II, III, V, and VI have been deleted.

			INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS
			FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
			NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
			OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE

			OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
			REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
			ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS
			AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</P>
			<P>8. TERMINATION. 
			</P>
			<P>8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
			terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein
			and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of
			the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly
			granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions
			which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
			termination of this License shall survive. 
			</P>
			<P>8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent
			infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against
			Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
			Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as
			&quot;Participant&quot;) alleging that: 
			</P>
			<P>(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or
			indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted
			by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
			License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
			prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice
			You either: 
			</P>
			<P>(i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable
			reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications
			made by such Participant, or</P>
			<P>(ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the
			Contributor Version against such Participant. 
			</P>
			<P>If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment
			arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties
			or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by
			Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
			terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified
			above.</P>
			<P>(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such
			Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly
			infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such
			Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective
			as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had
			made, Modifications made by that Participant. 
			</P>
			<P>8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against
			Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version
			directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is
			resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the
			initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
			value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections
			2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount
			or value of any payment or license. 
			</P>
			<P>8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2
			above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and
			resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any
			distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive
			termination. 
			</P>
			<P>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</P>
			<P>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
			(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
			INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
			COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO
			ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
			DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
			FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
			MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,
			EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
			SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
			LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S
			NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.
			SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF
			INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
			LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 
			</P>
			<P>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. 
			</P>
			<P>The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is
			defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial
			computer software'' and ''commercial computer software
			documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
			1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1

			acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein. 
			</P>
			<P>11. MISCELLANEOUS.

			subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to

			extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
			governed by California law provisions (except to the extent
			applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its
			conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in which at
			least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or
			registered to do business in the United States of America, any
			litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
			jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
			California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California,
			with the losing party responsible for costs, including without
			limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
			expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
			Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
			excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language
			of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
			apply to this License. 
			</P>
			<P>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. 
			</P>
			<P>As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party
			is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
			indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
			and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
			distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
			herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
			of liability. 
			</P>

			</P>
			<P>Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as
			&quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot;. &quot;Multiple-Licensed&quot; means
			that the Initial Devpoeloper permits you to utilize portions of
